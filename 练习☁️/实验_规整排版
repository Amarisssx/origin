        <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Autumn Day</h1>
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BY Lana Del Rey</h3>

        

<div>
    The gently rustling leaves<br> 
    sound like an ocean bay<br>
    calmly splashing against <br>
    the cool wet sand.<br>
    <br>
    </div>

<div>
    The lake ripples with the <br>
    colors of gray and silver.<br>
    The sky of ominous clouds<br> 
    is darker than gray,<br>
    with sunshine holes beaming<br>
    out of the corners of the sky.<br>
    <br>
</div>
    
<div>
    The not-too-distant sounds of cars<br>
    are mixed with the shaking<br>
    of pine needles and the <br>
    soft chirping of birds.<br>
    <br>
</div>
    

<div>As the afternoon grows dimmer,<br>
    the crickets sing their <br>
    cheerful songs of fall.<br>
    Across the lake the frosted tops <br>
    of blue mountains are slowly<br>
    becoming shadowed by <br>
    the overlapping clouds.<br>
    <br>
</div>
    

<div>The colors of fall are swirling <br>
    in the wind while the seagulls<br>
    are crouched low upon<br>
    the long waving blades of grass.<br>
    <br>
</div>
    

<div>The cool rushing wind is <br>
    racing itself through <br>
    the sky, sending shivers<br>
    to the people in its way.<br>
    Fall is happening everywhere<br>
    on this beautiful autumn day. <br>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
