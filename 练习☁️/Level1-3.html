        <h1>The Garden by Moonlight</h1>
        
        
        <h2>BY AMY LOWELL</h2>

        <p>A black cat among roses, <br>
            Phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, <br>
            The sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. <br>
            The garden is very still,<br>
            It is dazed with moonlight, <br>
            Contented with perfume, <br>
            Dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. <br>
            Firefly lights open and vanish <br>
            High as the tip buds of the golden glow <br>
            Low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. <br>
            Moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, <br>
            Moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush.<br>
            Only the little faces of the ladies' delight are alert and staring, <br>
            Only the cat, padding between the roses, <br>
            Shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern <br>
            As water is broken by the falling of a leaf. <br>
            Then you come, <br>
            And you are quiet like the garden, <br>
            And white like the alyssum flowers, <br>
            And beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. <br>
            Ah, Beloved, do you see those orange lilies? <br>
            They knew my mother, <br>
            But who belonging to me will they know <br>
            When I am gone.<br>
        </p>
